## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine-learning model for predicting music genres based on user demographics, specifically age, and gender. The model will utilize a dataset containing demographic information paired with music genre preferences. With the help of this model, we can predict the preferred music genre of users based on their age and gender.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of three columns: age, gender, and genre.


## Model Development
The model will be developed using machine learning techniques, likely employing algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks. Feature engineering may involve encoding categorical variables like gender and genre, and potentially scaling numerical features like age.

## Usage
The trained model can be integrated into various applications, such as music recommendation systems or targeted marketing campaigns. By understanding users' demographic characteristics, businesses can personalize music offerings and enhance user experience.
